//Objects in Java can only be instantiated with the new operator.
//MarkList obj1 = new MarkList();  As you can see, you allocate only one, and you get a pointer for it. Then you just make a second variable that stores a pointer, and that pointer points to the instance you allocated above.
//Since the keyword new, marking the call of a constructor, is only seen ONCE in the example code and the position of the constructor call is not inside a loop or a method which is called multiple times, it is safe to say that only ONE instance is created.

/*
Only one instance is created, but it is referenced three times.

The instance is created here:

MarkList obj1 = new MarkList();
And referenced by obj1:

MarkList obj1 = new MarkList();
obj2:
MarkList obj2 = obj1;

And object4
graceMarks(obj2);
